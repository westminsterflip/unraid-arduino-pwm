# unraid-arduino-pwm
Collection of scripts and files to make an Arduino generate pwm for fans under unRAID.  
Based on a post from [Kevin's Blog](https://kmwoley.com/blog/controlling-case-fans-based-on-hard-drive-temperature/) and implements a usb reset program [from here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=121459435621262&w=2)

If you don't have one already. create scripts a folder in /boot/config/:    `mkdir /boot/config/scripts`
